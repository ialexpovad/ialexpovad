# Hi, I‚Äôm Aliaksandr Povad (Alex Povod) üëã

## ‚ò¢Ô∏è About Me
- üíº I am a engineer/researcher with expertise in radiation equipment production for nuclear measurements and radiation monitoring. With a strong background in software programming, radiation transfer modeling, and data analysis, I am passionate about leveraging technology to tackle complex challenges in the field of radiation science.
- üî¨ I am currently working at an enterprise where I contribute to the development of cutting-edge radiation equipment. My main focus is on the field of software, where I use my knowledge of Python, C/C++ and C# to create reliable and efficient solutions for measuring and monitoring radiation. In addition, I specialize in modeling the transfer of radiation through matter using GEANT4, a powerful modeling tool widely used in the scientific community. Thanks to the introduction of GEANT4, I analyze and predict how radiation interacts with various materials, which allows me to optimize and improve the design of radiation equipment.

üí° If you are interested in radiation equipment development, radiation transfer modeling, software programming or data analysis in the context of radiation science, I would be happy to get involved and cooperate. Feel free to contact me to discuss potential collaborations, share ideas, or participate in stimulating discussions.
